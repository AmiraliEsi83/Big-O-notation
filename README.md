This project is to show Big O notation-Bubble sort
Big O describes the complexity of an algorithm when the time increases as the number of inputs(the size of the data)increases. That will show how the memory requirement will increase as n gets larger.
Big O notation shows a simple sorting algorithm-Bubble sort.
Heap sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), the same as Merge sort. But its space complexity is O(1).
That tells us that the Merge sort will use more and more memory as the size of the data increases.
Heap sort doesn't need more memory. O(1) is constant and doesn't change when you have more data to process.
